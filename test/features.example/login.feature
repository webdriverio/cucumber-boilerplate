Feature: Github test
    As a Developer in Test
    I want to test if the github.com failed login screen displays a error

Scenario: open URL
    Given I open the url "https://github.com/"
    Then  I expect that the url is "https://github.com/"
    And   I expect that the title is "GitHub Â· Where software is built"

Scenario: login with fake credentials
    Given I open the url "https://github.com/"
    When  I log in to site with username "marketionist" and password "1234"
    Then  I expect that element "#js-flash-container .flash-error" is visible
