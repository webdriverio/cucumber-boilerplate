Feature: Test the position of a given element
    As a developer
    I want to be able to test if a element has a certain position

    Background:
        Given I open the site "/"
        And   I have a screen that is 800 by 600 pixels
        And   the element "#square100x100" is 100px broad
        And   the element "#square100x100" is 100px tall
        When  I scroll to element "#square100x100"

    Scenario: The element #square100x100 is at XX pixels on the X axis
        Then  I expect that element "#square100x100" is positioned at 40px on the x axis

    @Pending
    Scenario: The element #square100x100 is at XX pixels on the Y axis
        Then  I expect that element "#square100x100" is positioned at 843px on the y axis

    Scenario: The element #square100x100 is not at YY pixels on the X axis
        Then  I expect that element "#square100x100" is not positioned at 101px on the x axis

    Scenario: The element #square100x100 is not at YY pixels on the y axis
        Then  I expect that element "#square100x100" is not positioned at 99px on the y axis
